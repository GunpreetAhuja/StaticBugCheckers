# This is the original pull request (pr) #112 used in the study.
# However, many of the additional projects (not in the official d4j), have wrong d4j properties
# and they don't compile right away. For the study, we have manually fixed all these errors.
# But adding our ad-hoc fixes to the pr is not easy and is not our goal as it is unofficial anyways.
# One alternative is to either restrict the reproduction to the original d4j.
# Or use a different and more recent (hopefully cleaner) pull requests such as pr #174

# NOTE: depending on which version is used, python/CheckoutD4j.py should be updated accordingly.
# as it now has the list of Defects projects identifiers and number of bugs encoded manually.

#D4J_PR="112"	# Comment out this line to use the most recent official release of the Defects4J.
							# Look at the note above. Don't forget to update python/CheckoutD4j.py.
